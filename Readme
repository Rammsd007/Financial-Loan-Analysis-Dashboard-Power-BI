ðŸ”· Project Title:
Financial Loan Analysis Dashboard â€“ Power BI

ðŸ“Œ Overview
This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of a financial institutionâ€™s lending operations using real-world-style loan data. The dashboard offers insights into loan performance, customer behavior, risk categorization, and month-over-month (MoM) and month-to-date (MTD) metrics using advanced DAX and custom visualizations.

ðŸ”¨ Tools Used
Power BI Desktop

DAX for custom measures

Power Query for data transformation

Excel (financial_loan.csv) as data source

ðŸ“Š Features & Visuals
Interactive visualizations:

Bar Chart

Multi-Row Card

Tree Map

KPI Cards

Donut Chart

Table

Slicers

Buttons and Shapes

Text Boxes

Custom visual grouping and layout formatting for enhanced readability.

Slicer interactions configured for intuitive filtering across visuals.

Export capability to Excel for deeper offline analysis.

ðŸ“ˆ KPIs & Measures Created Using DAX
Loan Performance

Total Loan Applications

Total Funded Amount

Total Amount Received

Good Loan Applications / Funded / Received

Bad Loan Applications / Funded / Received

Good Loan % vs Bad Loan %

Interest & Risk Metrics

Average DTI (Debt-to-Income Ratio)

Average Interest Rate

Time-based Metrics (MTD / MOM / PYMTD)

MTD Loan Applications / Funded / Received / Avg DTI / Avg Interest Rate

MOM% for Loan Applications / Funded / Received / Avg DTI / Avg Interest Rate

PYMTD Loan Applications / Funded / Received

ðŸ“… Date Table
A dedicated calendar table named Date was created using the CALENDARAUTO() function, with derived columns:

Year

Month

Month Name

Quarter

Day
This allows accurate time intelligence calculations for MTD, MOM%, and PYMTD metrics.

## ðŸ§® Key DAX Measures


ðŸ“… **1. Create a Date Table**
Purpose: Used to generate a continuous date table automatically based on the data range â€” essential for time intelligence calculations like MTD and MOM%.
```DAX
Date = CALENDARAUTO()


ðŸ”¢ 2. Total Loan Applications
Purpose:Calculates the number of unique loan applications, excluding blank IDs.
```DAX
Total Loan Applications = DISTINCTCOUNTNOBLANK(financial_loan[id])


ðŸ“ˆ 3. Average Interest Rate
Purpose : Calculates the average interest rate across all loans.
```DAX
Avg Interest Rate = AVERAGE(financial_loan[int_rate])


ðŸ“Š 4. Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)
Purpose:Calculates the average debt-to-income ratio of all applicants.
```DAX
Avg DTI = AVERAGE(financial_loan[dti])


ðŸ“† 5. MTD (Month-To-Date) Calculation
Purpose: To calculate cumulative metrics for the current month up to today.
```DAX
MTD Total Amount Received = 
CALCULATE(
    [Total Amount Received],
    DATESMTD('date'[Date])
)

ðŸ“† 6. PYMTD (Previous Month-To-Date) Calculation
Purpose: To compare the same period from the previous month.
```DAX
PYMTD Amount Received = 
CALCULATE(
    [Total Amount Received],
    DATESMTD(DATEADD('date'[Date], -1, MONTH))
)

ðŸ“‰ 7. MOM% (Month-on-Month Percentage Change)
Purpose: To measure percentage growth or decline from last month's performance to the current month.
```DAX
MOM% Total Loan Applications = 
DIVIDE(
    [DATESMTD Total Loan Applications] - [PYMTD TOTAL LOAN APPLICATIONS],
    [PYMTD TOTAL LOAN APPLICATIONS],
    "NA"
)

ðŸ§  Highlights
Created complex KPI measures with COALESCE, CALCULATE, FILTER, and time intelligence functions.

Handled data formatting challenges (e.g., converting "5M" text values into actual numbers).

Applied visual-level, page-level, and report-level filters to control interactions smartly.

Categorized loans into Good vs Bad Loans using domain logic based on loan_status.

Displayed loan application patterns by term, state, grade, home ownership, and more.

ðŸ“¤ How to Use
Download the .pbix file and open in Power BI Desktop.

Ensure financial_loan.csv is in the same folder and correctly loaded.

Explore each page (Summary, Menu, Details, Overview).

Use slicers (State, Grade, Good vs Bad Loan, etc.) to interact with the dashboard.
